# Automatic Suspend

Plugin for Oxwall software. Automatically suspends users who have been flagged a certain number of times.

##  Levarage your userbase to help prevent spam and abusive behavior 

There's no better way to prevent spam or abusive behavior than by having content checked and verified by humans. 

This plugin allow you to leverage your entire userbase to help you identify and deal with problematic content, by automating the suspension of problem-users flagged by your members.

##### Admins can adjust:

- Number of flags required before suspending
- What type of flagged items to look for
- Cron frequency (how often to run checks)
- Suspension-reason shown to suspended users
- Whether Moderators should be suspended

##### Can be adjusted to check or ignore flags on the following items:

- User Profiles
- Status Updates
- Forum Topics
- Forum Replies
- Groups
- Photos
- Videos
- Comments

##### Resource-respectful:
The plug-in will only run when it detects that new flags have been added since the last check.

##### Smart-checks:
The plug-in is smart enough to detect abusive behavior. If a single user flags someone else multiple times, the plug-in will only count 1 flag. This way, users can't get someone suspended by simply flagging all their content.
